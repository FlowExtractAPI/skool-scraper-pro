## ⚙️ Input Options

### 🔗 URL Modes Four ways to scope your extraction

The actor detects what to extract automatically from the URL format:

| URL Format | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skool.com/group/classroom` | Extract **all accessible courses** |
| `skool.com/group/classroom/38fd1c1d` | Extract **one specific course** |
| `skool.com/group/classroom/38fd1c1d?md=lessonId` | Extract **one specific lesson** |
| `skool.com/group/postName` | Extract **one specific post** (post data only) |

You can mix multiple URLs of different types in a single run.

```json
{
  "communityUrl": [
    "https://www.skool.com/my-community/classroom",
    "https://www.skool.com/my-community/01"
  ]
}
```

### ⬇️ Download Options

- **Default**: `false`
- Downloads images and document files (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.) attached to lesson posts
- Saved to Key-Value Store with keys like `image-{id}.png` / `doc-{id}.pdf`
- Each attachment in the dataset gets a `kvKey` field pointing to its stored file
- ⚠️ Increases run time large communities may have many attachments

#### `downloadResources` (Boolean)
- **Default**: `false`
- Downloads image and document files from the lesson resources panel
- Web links (YouTube, Chrome extensions, etc.) are automatically skipped only actual files are downloaded
- Each resource gets a `kvKey` field when downloaded
- ⚠️ Only useful if the community shares PDF guides or image files in lesson resources

### 🔐 `cookies` (Array)
- **Default**: `[]` (public content only)
- Provide browser cookies to access private or locked courses
- See [Authentication](#-authentication--private-content) section below

## 🔐 Authentication & Private Content

By default, the actor extracts only publicly accessible courses. To access **locked or private courses**, provide your Skool browser cookies.

### How to get your cookies

1. **Install the Cookie-Editor extension**
   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm)
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/)

2. **Log in to Skool**, then navigate to your community

3. **Open Cookie-Editor** → click **Export** → copy the JSON

4. **Paste into the `cookies` field** in actor input:
```json
{
  "cookies": [
    { "name": "session", "value": "your-session-value", "domain": ".skool.com" },
    { "name": "__stripe_mid", "value": "...", "domain": ".skool.com" }
  ]
}
```

> ⚠️ Cookies expire. If extraction fails with 403 errors, export fresh cookies and re-run.

## 💾 Key-Value Store

When `downloadAttachments` or `downloadResources` is enabled, downloaded files are saved to the actor's Key-Value Store organized by file type:

| Key prefix | Contents |
|---|---|
| `image-{id}.{ext}` | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP, TIFF |
| `doc-{id}.{ext}` | PDF, Word, Excel, CSV, TXT, JSON, XML |

Each downloaded file is referenced by `kvKey` on its parent attachment or resource object in the dataset, so you can always trace a file back to its lesson.

> **Note**: Apify Key-Value Store keys are limited to **63 characters**. All keys generated by this actor stay well within this limit.

---

## 🎬 Downloading Videos (Manual Future Feature)

The actor extracts `hostedVideo.playbackUrl` and `post.videos[].playbackUrl` for every lesson.

> 🔮 **Automatic video download within the actor is planned for a future release.**

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### No data extracted / empty dataset
- Community may require login provide cookies
- URL format may be wrong check the [URL Modes](#-url-modes--four-ways-to-scope-your-extraction) table
- Community slug is case-sensitive: `my-community` not `My-Community`

### `descriptionText` is empty
- Some lessons genuinely have no description this is normal
- If you expect a description, verify it's visible on the Skool lesson page when logged in

### Downloads fail with 403
- Assets hosted on external CDNs (e.g. giphy.com) may block direct downloads these are skipped automatically
- Skool assets (`assets.skool.com`) should always work; if they fail, try providing cookies

### Locked courses skipped
- Provide browser cookies from an account with access to those courses
- Only courses where `hasAccess: 1` are extracted

### Rate limiting / slow runs
- Increase `requestDelayMs` to `2500` or `3000`
- Large communities (100+ lessons) can take 10–20 minutes with the default delay
